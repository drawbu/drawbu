# hello there

Hello!

I'm Cl√©ment, a 21-year-old French CS student. I'm currently in San Francisco
for a grad exchange year at [SFSU](https://sfsu.edu), and was previously at
[Epitech Bordeaux](https://epitech.eu).

I'm a tech enthusiast: really passionate about computer science and programming.
Through the years, I fell in love with low level programming, and I'm now a big
fan of C & Rust (both for very differerent reason, but still).

I have been using Linux for multiple years now, first out of curiosity, now by
passion. I'm a big fan of NixOS, and I have been on Arch Linux for a while.
I enjoy the flexibility and the control I have over my system, and how it
helps me to learn more about it, and to be more efficient.

I can be versatile. I've worked at multiple French startups doing full-stack
development in TypeScript, but systems-level programming and low-level languages
in general have always been what keeps me motivated.

I am not your average tech bro, chasing AI hype or metrics, I just like writing
code, building solid tools, and enjoying the work. On my free time you can
either find me building tens of projects I will never finish, or contributing
to open source projects I like.
