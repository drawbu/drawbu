<h1>Hello there.</h1>

Hello!
I'm Clément, a 20 years old French student in computer science. I'm currently
at [Epitech Bordeaux](https://epitech.eu) in second year, after one year at the
public college l'Université de Bordeaux.

I'm a tech enthousiast: pationate about computer science and programming, I
always try to learn new technos and skills. Through the years, I fell in love
with low level programming, and I'm now a big fan of C, Rust, and Go
(this website is written entierely in Go, by the way). <br>
I have been using Linux for over two years, before by curiosity, now by passion.
I'm a big fan of NixOS, and I have been on Arch Linux for a while.
I appreciate the flexibility and the control I have over my system, and how it
helps me to learn more about it, and to be more efficient.

I'm a big fan of low level programming and have experience and willing to learn
more about C, C++, Rust or Go.

I put some websites in prod with SSL support using Nginx + systemd + ACME (you
can read about it
[here, on a acticle I made](https://drawbu.dev/blog/Server%20administration/Server%20block%20Ubuntu%20+%20Nginx%20+%20systemd)),
or [here](https://drawbu.dev/blog/Server%20administration/How%20I%20deploy%20Nix%20+%20Docker)
for a little more detailed article about deploying a Nix app with Docker (like
my website [drawbu.dev](https://drawbu.dev) for example.

I have been programming for over 5 years now, and I have been working on a lot
of projects, from small scripts to big applications. But everytime I start a new
project, I always learn something new, and I always try to improve my skills.

But, what truly matters to me is to learn new things, to go out of my confort
zone, and to be able to work on interesting projects, with interesting people
(sounds a bit cliché, but it's true). <br>
I have a few hobbies: developing useless stuff, playing Minecraft, and watching
a lot of series (seriously, please watch Breaking Bad, For All Mankind and The
Boys).
