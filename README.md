<h1>Hello there.</h1>

Hey everyone! I'm Clément (alias drawbu), a French student in computer science.
I'm currently at [Epitech Bordeaux](https://epitech.eu) in second year, after
one year at the public college [l'Université de Bordeaux](http://u-bordeaux.fr).

But the most important thing is, I'm a pationate about computer science, about
programming, I'm basically a nerd. I really enjoy learning new tools,
technologies, architectures, concepts, trying new things, and go out of my
confort zone.

Today, I'm on Linux, (with the holy NixOS) because I enjoy spending my time
tinkering and learning about the system. I have a fair amount of knowledge on
both Windows and macOS.

I'm a big fan of low level programming and have experience and willing to learn
more about C, C++, Rust or Go.

I also have some experience in web development, notably with React, Svelte and
Vue. I also have experience in back-end development with Node.js, and Python.

I put some websites in prod with SSL support using Nginx + systemd + ACME (you
can read about it
[here, on a acticle I made](https://github.com/drawbu/Notes/blob/main/Server%20administration/Server%20block%20Ubuntu%20%2B%20Nginx%20%2B%20systemd.md)).

I have a few hobbies: developing useless stuff, playing Minecraft, and watching
a lot of series (seriously, please watch Breaking Bad and For All Mankind).
